# Mod-1.0
A very simple Mod AI that uses a list of preset `bad words` that are given a score 

## Example Usage

Run the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/OpenGPT-Project/Mod
```

```
cd Mod
```

```
cd Mod-1.0
```

Then run the python script `use.py`:
```
python3 use.py
```

Once you run the script it will prompt you with:

```
Enter a sentence (or type 'exit' to stop):
```

Just type in something and then it will tell you if the AI predicts its offensive.

Do note that this AI can barly be called an AI and it is the most simple way to Mod. Please do not use this for major projects unless you know what you are doing or you have added more to the code.
